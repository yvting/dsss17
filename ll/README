This directory contains example LLVM IR code generated from factorial64.c.

The Makefile works only on Mac OS X (where gcc is aliased to clang), and is
provided only to show you which flags were given to the compiler.

The factorial.ml file gives an example OCaml program that has a structure
similar to the LLVM IR code.
