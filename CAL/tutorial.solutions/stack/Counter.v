(** This file is meant to demonstrate how the layer calculus used in CertiKOS
  works by implementing a simple layer consisting of a global counter variable
  [COUNTER] that can be accessed and manipulated by the primitives
  [get_counter], [incr_counter], and [decr_counter]. The counter variable is
  bounded within in the range [0] to [MAX_COUNTER] and the semantics are such
  that calling [incr_counter] (or [decr_counter]) when [COUNTER] is at its high
  (or low) bound results in an error. The underlay upon which this layer is
  built contains no abstract data or primitives. The overlay consists of the
  primitives described above and a [counter] of type [nat] as abstract data
  with the invariant that [counter <= MAX_COUNTER]. *)

Open Scope Z_scope.

(** The only constraint on the value of [MAX_COUNTER] is that it is less than
  the maximum unsigned integer divided by [4] since it will be used as an array
  index later on. We mark it [Opaque] to ensure that later proofs do not depend
  directly on its value. *)

    (** *** Underlay **)

    (** The underlay has no abstract data, we model this as [unit] and declare
      [unit] as layer data through the two typeclasses [AbstractDataOps] and
      [AbstractData].

      [AbstractDataOps] requires several fields. First, an initial element of
      the desired type ([unit] in our case). The other fields are predicates
      and invariants that we can simply instantiate with [True] predicates for
      the moment.

      The field [data_inv] specifies an invariant of the abstract data that
      must be preserved by all operations on abstract data.

      The field [data_inject] specifies how data is injected, i.e. how
      injections relate these abstract data, in a manner close to CompCert's
      [val_inject]. The only time this begins to get interesting is when you
      are dealing with pointers. *)

      data, as before. *)

      the underlay refines the low-level specification. Later, we will prove
      that the low-level specification refines the high-level specification. *)

    Context `{ce: ClightCompositeEnv}.

    (** We state our theorems in the form [underlay ⊢ (R, module) : overlay]
      which says that the code in the module executed on the underlay refines
      the overlay with respect to some relation R. What we actually want to
      prove, however, is a simulation diagram like the following:

<<
      (hargs, hstate)    high_spec_step   (hresult, hstate')
          ||            --------------->        ||

      (largs, lstate)    low_spec_step     (lresult, lstate')
>>

      In the code proofs, the overlay is the low level spec of some C
      primitive, and R is typically [id]. In this case we can simplify the
      diagram into:

<<
                      high_spec_step
      (args, state)  ---------------> (result, state')
                      low_spec_step
>>

      The tactic [code_proof_tac] will automatically convert the goal into
      the appropriate simulation diagram. You will then have to prove that the
      [cprimitive_step] relation holds between the initial and final states.
      [cprim_step] will convert this goal into one that states that the final
      state is reachable in a sequence of Clight steps. The [step_tac] tactic
      will try to prove all of the Clight smallstep semantics details and just
      leave you with a few remaining goals. *)

  Section LowHighSpecRel.
    (** Finally, we want to match the high-level specifications of our
      primitives to the low-level specifications.

      To achieve this, we need to build an abstraction relation ([abrel]),
      which requires two components:

      - [match_data]: a matching relation between the abstract data in the
        overlay and the memory state in the underlay

      - [relate_data]: a relation between high and low abstract data *)

    (** In our case, the [match_data] predicate states that the memory
      associated with the [COUNTER] variable must match [counter] in the high
      abstract data. *)

    | match_data_intro:

          (** The value at block [b] is an integer [i] *)
          Mem.load Mint32 m b 0 = Some (Vint i) ->
          (** The value of [counter] in the abstract data equals [i] *)
          counter abs = Z.to_nat (Int.unsigned i) ->
          match_data abs m.

      is trivial. *)
